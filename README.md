In the 21st century, animals suffer from abuse that if imposed on other humans would easily be labeled as sexist, racist, or some other term utilized to denote oppression.  Animals fall into three categories of domestic for food, domestic for companionship, and feral animals.  We view each group differently in terms of the treatment of rights.  Domestic animals used for food have the least number of rights.  Their well-being is not cared for, with disease and filth common in their environment.  Domestic animals used for companionship are placed on an elevated platform.  They are protected by laws from abuse.  If someone kills a companionship animal society labels them as a serial killer.  The rationale is that we have the same companionship with dogs, cats, i.e. as we do with other humans.  Feral animals like domestic for food have little rights.  Their environment is destroyed to put subdivisions, parking lots, and farms.  Hunting further drives the population into fear.  The remaining untouched populations suffer from pollution in their environment.  The ‘other’ groups of animals must be considered if we are to maintain the planet
